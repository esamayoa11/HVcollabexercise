# HVcollabexercise
This is Harrold Ventayen's website(or "ABOUT ME") for TKH collab assignment. 

The intention was to create a page that resembles a business card. It displays the nav bar and four clickable options that when a selection is clicked on, it makes the corresponding information appear in replace of the nav bar. Then there's a back button to take the user back to the opening nav bar if so desired. User can then click another option.  

I incorporated some opacity to the images to assist with readability and image flip of the HV.png just for fun.  

I also incorporated some Java to help make the hiding and appearing of the nav bar and contents hide and appear as needed.
